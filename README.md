ADS-507 Final Project using SQL

# Overview of the project
The project is intended to bring in three datasets in relation to human population and climate related factors (emissions and temperature). To that aim the team have been tasked by the 28th UN Conference of Parties (COP28) organizing committee to collect data from publicly available source systems with the goal of establishing a database system and pipeline that can be used for climate change impact analyses to inform recommendations for changes in global climate action policies. Specifically, the team will develop a tracking system for countries' temperature, emissions, and population change data so that policy recommendations can be given to the responsible agencies for each country regarding carbon emission targets and their association to global temperature trends to predict whether the agreed upon goals of not exceeding the 1.5 degrees Celsius are met.
