# Project to Establish a Data Engineering Pipeline
ADS-507 Final Project using SQL

#### -- Programming Languages: Python, MySQL
#### -- Project Status: [Active]

## Overview
The project is intended to bring in three datasets in relation to human population and climate related factors (emissions and temperature). To that aim the project team are working as if they have been tasked by the 28th UN Conference of Parties (COP28) organizing committee to collect data from publicly available source systems with the goal of establishing a database system and pipeline that can be used for climate change impact analyses to inform recommendations for changes in global climate action policies.

## Objectives
* Develop a data extract, tranform, load (ETL) pipeline that could be used as part of a tracking system for countries' temperature, emissions, and population change data.
* Automatically update data as it becomes available in the source systems.
* Automate transformations to mesh source data and the internal relational database management system (RDBMS) schema.
* Setup storage system for ready access to transformed data.


### Team Members
* Aaron Carr
* Annie Chan
* Kyle Esteban Dalope

### Methods Used
* Pipeline conceptulization
* API connectors
* Schema development and implementation
* Loading MySQL tables from CSV formatted files
* Data transformations


## Getting Started
